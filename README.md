# Indecision App

This is the first of two apps that I built while taking the Udemy React course.
I took this course to help fill in the gaps in my knowledge of react having been
mainly self-taught in the framework beforehand. Most of the code here was completed with guidance from the instructor, but many portions of it I made independently during the challenge sections of the course.

## Running the app locally

To run the app locally, clone this repository and navigate to the root of it
on your computer. Then, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev-server
```

After this, navigate to [the localhost server](http://localhost:8080/) in your preferred browser.
